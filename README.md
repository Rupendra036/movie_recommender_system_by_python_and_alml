I recently worked on an AI/ML project designed to analyze and visualize the Netflix dataset, offering insights into content distribution, genres, and ratings. The primary goal of this project was to explore patterns in content creation and consumption using machine learning techniques and statistical analysis.

Key components of the project included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and implementing algorithms to extract meaningful insights. I analyzed the dataset to understand release year distributions, genre frequencies, and content types (movies vs. TV shows). Furthermore, I investigated regional and language-based trends to uncover the diversity of content Netflix offers globally.

To assess user preferences, I leveraged IMDb scores and subscription plans, analyzing correlations to identify popular content types. Using the Poisson distribution, I modeled content ratings and created a predictive framework for future trends. The project also included visualizing the data using Tableau, building an interactive dashboard to make these insights accessible to non-technical users.

This project improved my expertise in Python and R for data manipulation and analysis, as well as my proficiency in tools like Tableau for visualization. It also deepened my understanding of statistical models and their real-world applications in data-driven decision-making.

The practical experience gained through this project has enhanced my problem-solving and analytical skills, preparing me for more advanced roles in AI and ML. This comprehensive analysis of a real-world dataset reflects the immense potential of machine learning in transforming the entertainment industry.
